          ‚Äúspontaneity‚Äù (read: forgetfulness), she brings organization, logic, and a gentle reminder

        Work is supposed to be about projects and deadlines, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwhat truly made it
        memorable were the
        <span class="font-semibold">people</span>. A team of insanely talented, hardworking
        individuals who somehow managed to get things done between
        <span class="italic">laughing at Teams memes</span> and
        <span class="italic">finding the perfect walking route</span> to squeeze in those extra
        <span class="italic">Google Fit Steps</span> while pretending to discuss work.

        <span class="font-semibold">"quick" stand-up meetings</span> that somehow lasted forever‚Äîall
        part of the glorious chaos. Some of the best brainstorming sessions happened outside meeting
        rooms, usually while <span class="italic">waiting in line for cafeteria lunch</span> and
        silently <span class="italic">judging the menu choices</span>. And let‚Äôs not forget the
        legendary <span class="font-semibold">post-work gossip walks</span>, where we solved
        everything‚Äîexcept our actual work problems.

        As for me, I had the privilege (and occasional struggle) of being a
        <span class="font-semibold">Humble Boss‚Ñ¢</span>. Leadership is all about vision, strategy,
        and, in my case, <span class="italic">strategically avoiding Excel sheets</span> while
        bribing my team with snacks. Sure, I had the title, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthe real
        decision-makers were my team (especially when it came to choosing the longest walking route
        just to avoid going back to our desks too soon).

        Looking back, I realize we weren‚Äôt just colleagues‚Äîwe were
        <span class="font-semibold">partners in crime</span>. We tackled deadlines like warriors,
        survived meetings that should‚Äôve been emails, and somehow managed to turn work into
        something we actually <span class="italic">enjoyed</span>.

          Leadership? Strategy? Crisis management? I thought I had it all figured out‚Äîuntil I became
          a father. My two daughters have perfected the art of negotiation (usually over bedtime),
          emotional intelligence (knowing exactly when to ask for ice cream), and high-level
          problem-solving (finding loopholes in every rule I set). If they ever form a startup, I
          might just be working for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then there‚Äôs my wife‚Äîmy <span class="font-semibold">Chief Reality Officer</span>.
          While I like to believe I‚Äôm the head of the family, she lets me hold that title‚Ä¶ just like
          a CEO in a company where the actual power lies elsewhere. She‚Äôs the
          <span class="font-semibold">Head of Logistics</span> (keeping everything running
          smoothly), and the
          <span class="font-semibold">Director of Quality Control and Household Police Chief</span>
          (keeping that watchful eyes, especially when I try to have 'life conversation' with the
          kids üòÇ). If marriage has taught me one thing, it‚Äôs this:
          <span class="italic">she's always right‚Ä¶ even when she's not (but she is).</span>

        <p>
          I dedicate this blogsite to my <b>daughters</b> (Riya & Tiya) ‚Äî my greatest adventure, my
          toughest negotiators, and my future world-changers. May you always lead with kindness,
          curiosity, and just enough mischief to keep life interesting. And to my wife, my daily
          reminder that leadership isn‚Äôt about power‚Äîit‚Äôs about knowing when to just nod and say,
          <span class="italic">"Yes, dear."</span> üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
