title: Places I stayed
date: 1st Apr 2025
description: Every place I’ve called home, even briefly, has left a mark on my journey. From bustling cities to quiet corners, each stay added a chapter to my story. Each of these places gave me something — a moment, a lesson, or just a quiet smile. They weren’t just locations on a map, they were stories I now carry with me.
