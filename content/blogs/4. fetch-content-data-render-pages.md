## McDonald's in the UK: Strategies for Sustainable Growth

### SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths

- **Global Strategy – “Think Global, Act Local”:** McDonald’s operates
  in over 100 countries, tailoring menus and marketing strategies to
  suit local tastes. In the UK, it offers items like the _Bacon Roll_
  and _Spicy Veggie Wrap_, catering to local palates.

- **Market Leader:** McDonald’s holds the largest market share in the
  global fast-food sector, with over 1,400 outlets in the UK as of 2023.

- **Strong Brand Recognition:** Ranked 8th in Forbes’ Brand Relevance
  Index, McDonald’s is a household name synonymous with consistency and
  affordability.

- **Strict Quality Control:** A robust supply chain ensures consistent
  product quality across all locations.

#### Weaknesses

- **Limited Product Innovation:** McDonald’s has been criticized for
  slow responses to food trends, such as veganism and organic diets.

- **Franchise Network Issues:** Variability in service and quality
  across franchises affects customer experience.

- **Logistics and Transportation Challenges:** McDonald’s faces
  occasional disruptions in its UK supply chain due to Brexit and fuel
  shortages.

- **Low Product Differentiation:** Many items are perceived as generic,
  reducing the incentive to choose McDonald’s over competitors.

#### Opportunities

- **Expansion into Emerging Markets:** Joint ventures in Asia and Africa
  offer growth potential.

- **Health-Focused Product Lines:** Launch of the McPlant (plant-based
  burger) in the UK is a strategic response to rising veganism.

- **Tech-Enabled Ordering:** Investing in mobile apps and self-service
  kiosks enhances customer convenience and reduces wait times.

- **Green Packaging Initiatives:** The UK led the way with paper straws
  and fully recyclable packaging.

#### Threats

- **Strong Competition:** Rivals like Subway, Pret A Manger, KFC, and
  Greggs continuously challenge McDonald’s market position.

- **Health Awareness:** A UK Public Health England campaign encouraging
  reduced fast-food consumption has impacted customer choices.

- **Cultural Sensitivities:** Diverse diets and food taboos require
  careful product localization.

### Corporate Strategy

#### Supply Chain Management

McDonald’s UK sources ingredients from over 17,000 British and Irish
farms. For instance, all eggs used in the UK restaurants are free-range,
and milk comes from British dairy farms. The company uses a
_“farm-to-fork”_ traceability system to ensure quality and safety.

The FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory method minimizes waste and
ensures freshness. During Brexit-related supply disruptions in 2021,
McDonald’s temporarily removed milkshakes and bottled drinks from menus
due to a lack of drivers—highlighting the need for resilient logistics
planning.

#### Leadership and Cost Strategy

McDonald’s uses localized pricing strategies. For example, a Big Mac in
London costs approximately £4.59, compared to just £2.40 in India. This
localization allows the brand to maximize market penetration while
adhering to regional economic standards.

#### Business Strategy

##### Product Strategy and Localization

McDonald’s has adapted its UK menu with items like the _McPlant_,
developed in collaboration with Beyond Meat. In 2019, it introduced
_Wrap of the Day_, which became highly popular among office-goers.

**Price Bundling** like the Saver Menu (e.g., £1.99 for a cheeseburger
and small fries) encourages larger order volumes. Seasonal items like
the _Festive Stack_ tap into British holiday traditions.

##### Branding and Partnerships

Strategic alliances, including sponsorships with the Premier League and
FIFA World Cup, keep McDonald’s front-of-mind for sports fans. It also
partners with charities like _FareShare_ and _Ronald McDonald House
Charities_ to boost social responsibility credentials.

#### Human Resource Strategy

McDonald’s was the first UK company to offer a _Level 2 Apprenticeship
in Hospitality_ in partnership with City & Guilds. It has over 20,000
apprenticeships completed in the UK.

Employee perks include:

- Flexible scheduling

- Opportunities for promotion from crew to management

- Bonuses and “Employee of the Month” recognitions

- Free meals and holiday pay

#### Functional Strategy

##### Quick Service

The UK average wait time at McDonald’s drive-thrus is just 3 minutes, a
competitive benchmark in fast food. Innovations like digital kiosks and
click-and-collect apps help maintain this efficiency.

##### Cleanliness and Hygiene

Mystery shopper reports, internal audits, and real-time feedback help
maintain high hygiene standards. During COVID-19, McDonald’s UK
implemented over 50 new safety procedures including contactless delivery
and table service.

##### Management and Employee Performance

Shift managers receive leadership training and are responsible for KPIs
like speed of service, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction. Employees
use handheld devices to take orders during rush hours, improving
throughput and accuracy.

#### Marketing Strategy

##### Sales Promotion

Contests like _“Monopoly at McDonald’s”_ generate excitement. In 2022,
the Monopoly campaign increased UK store visits by 12% during its run.

##### Public Relations

McDonald’s UK has emphasized transparency by publishing sourcing
information online. Campaigns like _“Follow Our Foodsteps”_ allowed
customers to trace the journey of their meal from farm to tray.

##### Direct Marketin

Personalized promotions via the McDonald’s App offer discounts like
“£1.49 McChicken Sandwich” on Mondays. Push notifications based on
location and buying history increase footfall.

##### Personal Sellin

Employees are trained to engage customers courteously within a tight
time window. In-store surveys and touch screens provide instant
feedback, influencing menu and service improvements.

##### Advertising

Billboards showcasing the _“Just the Cheese”_ campaign, TikTok
collaborations with UK influencers, and cinematic TV ads—such as the
2020 _“Inner Child”_ Christmas ad—help build emotional connections with
audiences.

### Transformation of the UK Market

#### Challenges (Pre-2003)

- **Declining Same-Store Sales:** Negative growth due to stale menus and
  poor service.

- **Franchisee Dissatisfaction:** Poor communication and support
  weakened franchise relationships.

- **Negative Public Perception:** McDonald’s was synonymous with “junk
  food” and poor employment.

#### Strategic Interventions

- **“Plan to Win” Strategy (2003):** Focused on food, people, place,
  price, and promotion.

- **Healthier Menu:** Salads, fruit bags, and organic milk introduced.
  UK was the first to offer fruit in Happy Meals.

- **Store Modernization:** Introduction of digital menus, WiFi, USB
  ports, and revamped interiors.

- **Workplace Reform:** Flexible family jobs, internal promotions, and
  apprenticeships transformed the image of a “McJob.”

As a result, McDonald’s UK witnessed a significant turnaround. By 2020,
it had a customer satisfaction score of 82% (YouGov), and its UK revenue
exceeded £1.5 billion annually.

### Challenges faced by McDonalds in UK

#### Unhappy Franchisees – Poor Network

Declining per store sales resulting in unhappy franchisees. This is an
issue for the company since it creates tensions between the franchisees
and the company. These tensions can cause major disruptions in the well
functioning of McDonald's. A low or even negative per-store sales can
also have a negative effect on future franchisees applications. The main
reasons behind this trend can be attributable to McDonald's expansion
growth policy in the mid 1990's, the menu and the decline in the
standards of quality, service and cleanliness.

#### Menu Items

A major domestic challenge for McDonald's is the menu. it is believed
that the domestic per-store sale decrease is partly due to older
customer drifting away. So McDonald's tried to target this segment of
the market by introducing its first "grownup taste" sandwich.
Segmentation was introduced in order to manage the different customer
needs by identifying homogenous market segments. However, McDonald's
attempt failed. Furthermore, the decline in growth can also be
attributable to the shift in the public opinion towards eating healthy
food.

#### Standards of quality, service and cleanliness

Another reason for the decline in same-store sales major can be related
to the fact that the standards of quality, service and cleanliness,
which is one of McDonald's core competencies, were declining. a survey
in 1995 gave poor results for the company in terms of food, service and
cleanliness. In addition, a 2001 study ranked McDonald's among the
poorest-performing fast-food chains with 11 percent of customers
dissatisfied because of slow service, wrong orders, dirty stores, and
rude employees. Since McDonald's jobs are not very appealing, the pool
of applicants that remained may not have been very competent and not as
friendly as they should have been.

#### Localization Challenges

One of the reasons might be that McDonald's don't seem to have done an
extensive market research. They need to search for what the customer
want and need and understand why it is maybe the case that older
customer are not eating anymore at McDonald's. This could be done
through surveys, focus groups and interviews. However, McDonald's could
use some consumer-oriented strategies to deeper consumer involvement.
One of the major problems was consumers‘ perceptions about McDonald‘s as
a promoter of obesity.

#### Competition

The company also faced some tough competition from fast food chains like
Subway7 and Wendy‘s International, Inc. (Wendy‘s), and other outlets
like Starbucks Corporation (Starbucks) in the UK.

### Factors/Strategy responsible for change in the situation

- In order to enhance its brand reputation in the UK and to improve
  sales, McDonald‘s focused on four core areas — food, employees, the
  environment, and communities.

- It introduced several new items on the menu, revamped restaurants,
  launched community programs, and introduced accredited qualifications
  and apprenticeships for its employees in the UK.

- In 2003, McDonald‘s adopted the ‘Plan to Win‘ strategy in the UK
  market in order to increase sales. As part of this strategy,
  McDonald‘s offered variety and value and tastier food besides improved
  service to customers.

- To cater to the health-conscious customers, it introduced healthier
  foods such as salads and provided nutritional information about its
  products on food packages

- The fast food chain launched an affordable breakfast menu along with
  premium coffee across its outlets in the UK.

- To attract customers, McDonald‘s redesigned its stores in the UK and
  introduced modern technology to compete in the highly competitive UK
  fast food market.

- Instead of adding new stores, it closed down stores which were not
  performing well and those that lacked modern interiors.

- The company also had to work hard on the Human Resource (HR) front as
  it tried to get rid of the negative perceptions associated with
  working at McDonald‘s in the UK.

- Price reviews were undertaken at McDonald‘s on a regular basis to
  ensure that both customers as well as suppliers benefited.

- To erase its image of a junk food provider from the minds of the
  customer, it provided nutritional information about every product it
  sold at its restaurants.

- According to the company, it had to stop offering the super size
  option because it was not popular among customers and accounted for
  less than 0.1% of all UK sales.

- In 2003, McDonald‘s UK introduced fruits as part of its Happy Meals
  for children. The UK was the first market in which the burger giant
  was introducing fruit bags as part of its menu. It also introduced
  organic milk on the menu.

- Besides the menu, McDonald‘s redesigned the traditional look of its
  restaurants in the UK to give them a café-styled modern look.

- McDonald‘s also launched incentives for its employees in the UK such
  as family job-sharing schemes. To dispel the perceptions associated
  with ‘McJobs‘ and to enhance its employer brand image, McDonald‘s
  provided its employees with the opportunity to advance in the
  organization and offered comprehensive training programs to all staff
  levels and promoted them from within.

## Conclusion

McDonald’s remarkable recovery and success in the UK underscore the
power of strategic alignment across corporate, business, and functional
levels. By understanding customer needs, investing in innovation, and
improving employee satisfaction, the brand has not only remained
competitive but has also become a beloved part of British food culture.
